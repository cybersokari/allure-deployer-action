## Setup Notes

- **GitHub Pages Hosting:**
  - Ensure `github_token` permissions include `contents: write` and `actions: write`
    - `contents: write` permission is used to push report files to `github_pages_branch`
    - `actions: write` is used to back up Allure History and Retries as GitHub Artifacts.
  - Ensure that GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the `github_pages_branch` provided. Default branch is `gh-pages` 
- **Firebase Hosting:**  
  Export a [service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments) JSON file from your Firebase Console.
- **Pull Request Comments:**  
  Ensure `github_token` permissions include `pull_requests: write` and `issues: write`.
- **Slack Integration:**  
  Create a Slack app, and generate a token for notifications.
